### Added

- *(gateway)* [**breaking**] align embedding APIs ([#3818](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3818))
- *(net)* [**breaking**] simplify origin scoping ([#3804](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3804))

- *(net)* [**breaking**] one name per announce, request, and origin config concept ([#3725](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3725))
- *(hang)* [**breaking**] one continuous broadcast clock at the catalog root ([#3675](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3675))

### Fixed

- *(hls)* advertise only playable renditions ([#3824](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3824))

### Other

- Unify mux track and rendition ownership ([#3857](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3857))
- *(net)* [**breaking**] name path roles without new types ([#3826](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3826))

- Merge origin/main into dev
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into merge-main-into-dev-20260914

### Changed

- [**breaking**] Read the broadcast timeline from `catalog.archive`
  instead of the removed root `timeline` entry.

### Fixed

- Answer 404 for a segment the relay cannot serve because the group is not cached or the publisher is gone, and 500 only for a genuine failure. Classification uses the named moq-lite stream codes (local variants and received `Error::Stream` codes), so a miss that crossed a session no longer   looks like an internal error. IETF stream-reset misses still answer 500.
