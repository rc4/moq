- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into dev

### Added

- `group::Producer::used` waits until the group has a consumer, matching `unused`.
- `StreamError::ControlTimeout` (moq-lite stream code 0x31): a request stream torn down because the peer never answered, distinct from `DeliveryTimeout`. The moq-transport registry has no value for it, so an IETF peer is sent INTERNAL_ERROR.

### Fixed

- An origin front drops the source track when its last reader leaves, instead of holding the upstream copy for `TRACK_IDLE_LINGER`.

### Changed

- [**breaking**] `stats::Registry::report` refills a caller-owned `&mut Report` instead of returning a new one, so an interval drain reuses its buffers.
- [**breaking**] Dead exports removed: `Hops::replace_first`, `origin::Dynamic::{hop, root}`, `DRAIN_COST` / `MAX_COST` (use `Cost::{DRAIN, MAX}`), `broadcast::Producer::remove_track`, `track::Producer::start_sequence`, `Subscriber::with_groups`, `Ordered::with_groups`, `group::Consumer::with_frames`, `cache::Pool::same_pool`, `Timestamp::new_const`, `Error::to_code`, `Route::with_hop` (build `Hops` and use `with_hops`), and `Cost: From<(u64, u64)>` (use `Cost { warm, cold }`).
- [**breaking**] `track::SubscriberControl` is `track::Control`, `track::GroupRequest` is `group::Request`, `ConnectionStats` is `session::Stats` with `estimated_send_rate` / `estimated_recv_rate` as `Option<bandwidth::Rate>`, and the paused handshake `Request<S, R>` is `server::Handshake`.
- [**breaking**] `create_track`, `reserve_track`, `unique_track`, `finish`, `create_group`, and `append_group` take `&self`. `track::Consumer::info()` is `query()`. `track::Demand` gains `is_used` / `poll_used` / `poll_unused`. `track::Producer::poll_unused` returns `Poll<Result<()>>`. `bandwidth::Producer::closed()` returns the cause.
- [**breaking**] `stats::Presence` and `stats::Traffic` name both edges of each cumulative pair `*_started` / `*_ended` (`sessions_started` / `sessions_ended`, `announces_started` / `announces_ended`, `broadcasts_*`, `subscriptions_*`). Serialize still writes the previous `announced` / `*_closed` names beside the new ones; deserialize accepts either spelling, with the canonical name winning.
- [**breaking**] `origin::Info` is `origin::Config` with public fields and no `with_*` builders. `Producer::info()` is `config()`.
- [**breaking**] `origin::Config::default()` mints a random hop, `Config::id` is `hop`, and origin handles expose `hop()` instead of dereferencing to `Hop`. Random hops stay below 2^53, so legacy `@moq/lite` clients limited to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` still decode them; current `@moq/net` clients decode the full 62-bit wire range as `bigint`.
- [**breaking**] `origin::Producer::scope(root, patterns)` and `origin::Consumer::scope(root, patterns)` replace the separate `with_root` / `scope` calls and return `Result` with `Unauthorized` for an empty grant.
- [**breaking**] `origin::Pending` is `origin::Requesting`, the consumer-side wait for a request to resolve.
- `origin::Producer::publish(path, route)` creates and advertises a broadcast together.
- [**breaking**] `track::Producer::write_datagram(Datagram)` is now `insert_datagram(sequence, timestamp, payload)`, matching TypeScript `insertDatagram`. The supplied sequence is preserved; `append_datagram` remains the next-sequence convenience.
- [**breaking**] `Timescale` no longer implements `From<NonZero<u64>>`. Use `Timescale::new` or `TryFrom` so values above the QUIC varint range are refused at construction.
- Register moq-lite stream codes NOT_FOUND 0x33, OLD 0x34, and EVICTED 0x35 so a cache miss round-trips as the named variant instead of an opaque reserved-range placeholder.
- Every received protocol code is `Error::Session` / `Error::Stream`, preserving
  its registry and numeric value, including cancellation and internal-error codes.
