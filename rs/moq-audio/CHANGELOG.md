- *(net)* [**breaking**] slim the moq-net public surface ([#3779](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3779))

- *(moq-audio,moq-video)* build capture and Android again, and gate both on PRs ([#3850](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3850))
- *(ci)* repair nightly and meta-review failures ([#3799](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3799))
- *(net)* drop origin source track when last reader leaves

### Other

- *(rs)* read constant-size chunks with as_chunks ([#3899](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3899))
- *(quest)* complete the media release review ([#3878](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3878))
- Report dropped playback sample frames ([#3845](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3845))
- *(audio)* [**breaking**] separate configuration contracts ([#3843](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3843))
- *(audio)* [**breaking**] expose demand without track authority ([#3842](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3842))

- Make media backends optional ([#3839](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3839))
- *(audio)* [**breaking**] remove ineffective FEC flag ([#3841](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3841))
- Merge origin/main into dev
- Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/main' into merge-main-into-dev-20260914

### Changed

- PipeWire and PulseAudio host flags no longer activate device I/O without
  `capture` or `playback`.
- [**breaking**] separate source PCM, codec settings, decoded output, and subscription policy;
  replace ambiguous channel counts with `Layout` and add explicit decoder backend selection.
- [**breaking**] `encode::Producer::finish` borrows (`&mut self`) instead of consuming, so a later
  `abort(self)` can still run after a clean end. Writes after finish fail with `Closed`.
- [**breaking**] `encode::Producer::track` is replaced by the watch-only `demand()`,
  `publish_capture` takes `PublicationOptions`, `Resampler` is no longer exported, and
  `Frame` and `encode::Encoded` are non-exhaustive with `new` constructors.
- [**breaking**] The `fec` flag is removed from `encode::Settings` and `Options`; it never
  produced redundancy.
- [**breaking**] `aec::Canceller` is `aec::Control`, `playback::Engine::canceller` returns
  `Result`, and `capture::Config::aec` takes a `Control`. An engine owns one AEC reference and a
  control attaches to one live microphone; conflicts fail with `Error::Busy`.
- [**breaking**] `playback::Sink::write` returns `playback::Write`, reporting accepted and
  dropped input sample frames instead of silently discarding overflow.

- *(audio,video)* compile the device, render, and VAAPI code by default ([#3353](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3353))

## [0.0.22](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/compare/moq-audio-v0.0.21...moq-audio-v0.0.22) - 2026-09-02

- *(moq-audio)* negotiate a stereo output before a mono one ([#3327](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/3327))

### Added

- [**breaking**] *(moq-audio)* report Opus discontinuous transmission as an `Activity` on the audio itself: `Frame` gains an `activity` field (build one with the new `Frame::new`), `Encoder::encode` returns `encode::Encoded`, `Decoder::decode` returns `decode::Decoded`, and `encode::Producer::activity` reports what was published most recently ([#2481](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/issues/2481))
- [**breaking**] *(moq-audio)* reject an Opus bitrate too low for the frame duration to code any audio, which libopus otherwise accepts and answers with empty frames

## [0.0.4](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/compare/moq-audio-v0.0.3...moq-audio-v0.0.4) - 2026-06-16

## [0.0.3](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/compare/moq-audio-v0.0.2...moq-audio-v0.0.3) - 2026-06-10

### Added

- *(moq-video,moq-cli)* webcam capture and publish ([#1669](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/1669))
- *(hang,json,moq-mux)* generic catalog with application extensions ([#1658](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/pull/1658))

### Added

- `capture` feature: `capture::Microphone` captures an input device via cpal
  (pure-Rust: CoreAudio / WASAPI / ALSA) yielding PCM frames, and
  `capture::publish_microphone` runs the mic -> Opus -> publish loop on demand
  (the catalog is registered up front from the device format, but the mic only
  opens while a subscriber is listening). Off by default so audio-only consumers
  don't pull cpal / ALSA. Encoding stays on unsafe-libopus.
- `AudioProducer` timestamps are now anchored to the first frame's wall clock,
  with `reset_epoch()` to re-anchor after an idle gap (so a released-and-reopened
  microphone stays aligned with a wall-clock video track rather than compressing
  the gap out). Mirrors moq-boy.
