# m1: next wave

## Goal

The next wave, in priority order: reliability, new capabilities, performance,
and the planning that settles their shared contracts.

## Plan

Planning and implementation are distinct dispatches: a ready planning quest
produces decisions, fixtures, and rewritten implementation quests, not
speculative production code. Later work waits in [m2](/quest/m2/README.md).

Give one agent ownership of each shared code area at a time (origin/auth, the
JS Reader, audio playback, media containers and archive, bindings, worker
transport, benchmark tooling); worktrees isolate commits, not semantics.

## Required

- [Late joiner history](/quest/m1/relay-late-joiner-history.md) - a subscriber joining a relay's track from group 0 later still receives the cached finished group below the live one
- [Cluster routing](/quest/m1/cluster-routing.md) - an announcement says where a broadcast originates, not how to reach it, and a relay hears only the prefixes its clients asked for
- [Track tail interop](/quest/m1/track-tail-interop.md) - a Rust publisher ending a track with a group in flight is read to its end by the JS subscriber, and the reverse, in `just test interop`
- [Worker socket count](/quest/m1/worker-socket-count.md) - the moq-tokio worker test counts only its own listener's sockets
- [Binding audio delay](/quest/m1/binding-surface.md) - moq-ffi and every wrapper configure and observe audio playout delay
- [moq-binary folds into moq-flate](/quest/m1/flate-binary.md) - on dev, moq-flate and @moq/flate own the opaque snapshot and stream tracks and moq-binary is deleted
- [FFI shape](/quest/m1/ffi-shape/README.md) - the bindings mirror Rust's layers: net at the root, then media, json, flate, audio, and video namespaces built from the handle below
- [Track demand](/quest/m1/track-demand.md) - Rust and JS watch a track's subscribers through `demand()` alone
- [Error messages](/quest/m1/error-display.md) - Python, Go, and Dart print `MoqError` with Rust's message, as Kotlin and Swift do
- [Session close](/quest/m1/session-close.md) - a graceful session end withdraws announces and waits one second for the ack
- [Raw stream codes](/quest/m1/raw-stream-codes.md) - raw QUIC stream resets and stops carry the application's code, not an HTTP/3-mapped one
- [Live in apps](/quest/m1/announce-live-apps.md) - the demo and `@moq/room` show "no broadcasts" from the `live` marker, which waits for the first session on page load
- [Page-load marker](/quest/m1/announce-page-load.md) - an announcement stream opened before the first connection waits for its replay before `live`
- [Empty state](/quest/m1/announce-empty-state.md) - watch, room, and the demo show "no broadcasts" once `live` arrives with nothing announced
- [JS active count](/quest/m1/js-active-count.md) - @moq/net speaks MoQ Active Count, so its IETF announce consumers go live without a timer
- [Watch refusal](/quest/m1/watch-refusal.md) - `<moq-watch>` shows an origin refusal as an error instead of sitting offline
- [kio waiter overflow](/quest/m1/kio-waiter-lost.md) - a retained `Waiter` past 8 lists stops adding a duplicate entry to lists it already recorded
- [Capture re-anchor](/quest/m1/capture-reanchor.md) - a repeating or restarting device clock never rewinds native capture during a fast backlog drain
- [Splice edge cases](/quest/m1/splice-edges.md) - an unstamped successor, a pruned segment's boundary group, and a warm head during a takeover are each handled correctly
- [Resumed groups](/quest/m1/resume-latest.md) - a half-delivered group ends once the new copy is past it, so a group-only reader never parks after a mid-group failover
- [Track tail hardening](/quest/m1/track-tail-hardening.md) - Rust and JS wait out a track's tail by the same rules, with the known hang, count, truncation, grace, and memory holes closed
- [SUBSCRIBE_DROP](/quest/m1/subscribe-drop.md) - every stream group in a lite subscription arrives or is dropped by name, and lite-07 drops its stream count for it
- [Session death parity](/quest/m1/session-death.md) - a local close ends tracks cleanly in both languages, and JS group readers see the session's error on session death
- [moqsrc stop](/quest/m1/moqsrc-stop.md) - moqsrc's stop blocks until its session ends, without deadlocking on a blocked pad push
- [More tests under load](/quest/m1/test-flakes-2.md) - the second round of load-only failures, fixed at the cause
- [Auth outage clock](/quest/m1/auth-outage-clock.md) - the relay and moq-auth outage tests run on a paused clock again and assert both bounds of `expires`
- [Legacy end overshoot](/quest/m1/legacy-end-overshoot.md) - browser playback survives a group that starts inside the previous group's estimated end
- [Slow group log](/quest/m1/slow-group-log.md) - a starved viewer reports skipped groups once per catch-up, not once per group
- [UnknownSession log flood](/quest/m1/unknown-session-logs.md) - streams reset before their WebTransport header stop being reported as UnknownSession at WARN
- [Merge queue](/quest/m1/merge-queue.md) - the required checks run on `merge_group`, so a stale green check can no longer break main
- [Wire compatibility](/quest/m1/wire-compat.md) - a nightly run tests this checkout against the last published release for tokens, session wire, and catalog/container
- [Accept-side flags](/quest/m1/cli-given-flags.md) - dial-only and local verbs refuse every `--listen-*` flag instead of ignoring it
- [#2075](/quest/m1/2075-mirror-catalog-reservation-gating-in-moq-hang-js-hang.md) - @moq/publish gates the first catalog snapshot until every reserved track is described
- [Full codec string](/quest/m1/publish-codec-string.md) - browser-published video carries the encoder's full RFC 6381 codec string, so native players decode it
- [TS export jitter](/quest/m1/ts-export-jitter.md) - the video reorder bound follows later catalogs and the declared reorder depth, so a late B-frame never reorders TS output; an undeclared stream can reorder once per new maximum depth
- [TS import shared shift](/quest/m1/ts-import-shared-shift.md) - unflagged loop wraps move audio and video by one shift, so A/V sync holds across wraps
- [PipeWire duplicate cameras](/quest/m1/pipewire-dup-cameras.md) - a webcam lists once with PipeWire enabled
- [Catalog wall clock](/quest/m1/catalog-wall-clock.md) - `Clock::wall_clock` keeps the catalog's full precision instead of truncating to milliseconds
- [Capture control](/quest/m1/capture-control.md) - on dev, `encode::Capture` replaces `CaptureOptions` without a `clock` field (it reads the catalog's), an unsupported `cut()` errors, and dropping the last `Control` cancels in-flight opens
- [Video surface](/quest/m1/video-surface.md) - on dev, moq-ffi's `native` becomes `surface`, refused on platforms with no surface
- [HLS discontinuity sequence](/quest/m1/hls-discontinuity-sequence.md) - on dev, `Segment::discontinuity` is the absolute sequence, so every cursor agrees
- [Auth client CA](/quest/m1/relay-auth-client-ca.md) - on dev, `auth::Config::validate` and `init` take the client-CA flag, so no caller can skip the check
- [RTMP TLS only](/quest/m1/rtmp-tls-only.md) - an RTMP listener configured for TLS can refuse plaintext instead of sniffing and serving it
- [HLS linger](/quest/m1/hls-linger.md) - `moq_hls::Server` serves an ended broadcast for its playlist window plus grace, so the moq.pro edge drops its own pool
- [Remove live()](/quest/m1/remove-live.md) - on dev, importers publish stream timestamps verbatim, the catalog clock maps them to wall time, and an encoder restart becomes a new epoch
- [iroh versions](/quest/m1/iroh-lite-wip.md) - `iroh://` negotiates the configured versions, so `moq-lite-07-wip` can be opted into
- [Go and Dart doc samples](/quest/m1/doc-samples-go-dart.md) - Go and Dart doc samples compile against their wrappers
- [Data capture in bindings](/quest/m1/data-capture-bindings.md) - moq-ffi and every wrapper pass a data frame's capture time, and the JSON window producer takes one
- [Moxygen compatibility](/quest/m1/moxygen/README.md) - one subgroup per group, whole-group FETCH, and one datagram per group, never a full moxygen pass
- [JS IETF datagrams](/quest/m1/js-ietf-datagram.md) - `@moq/net` sends and receives datagram groups over moq-transport, like Rust
- [#2991](/quest/m1/2991-net-coalesce-dynamic-tracks-and-preserve-sequences-across.md) - one dynamic producer per track name in both languages, with the sequence namespace surviving a replacement
- [JavaScript FETCH](/quest/m1/js-fetch.md) - generic on-demand group serving and IETF FETCH for browser publishers
- [Archive](/quest/m1/archive/README.md) - record selected tracks to any object_store and replay them over FETCH or derived HLS; the catalog entry and format may break in place, since no archives exist
- [Tooling](/quest/m1/tooling/README.md) - justfiles become a one-line menu over `sh/`, one impact map scopes CI, and every workflow step runs a recipe
- [Path patterns](/quest/m1/path-patterns.md) - one matcher for every predicate over broadcast paths: tokens, origins, interest
- [In-band auth](/quest/m1/auth/README.md) - a session tells its peer what it may publish and subscribe to, unions tokens presented in band, and fails loud on an out-of-scope publish
- [Dropped sources](/quest/m1/dropped-sources.md) - track consumers see the producer's real error on every end path, never `Dropped`
- [Shaper virtual time](/quest/m1/shaper-virtual-time.md) - `moq-shaper` tests judge seeded decisions on paused time, not on wall-clock delivery under load
- [Rust compressed gate test](/quest/m1/json-compressed-gate-rs.md) - `rs/moq-json` proves a snapshot delta is gated on its encoded size
- [Shrink the JS overflow test](/quest/m1/json-rolls-snapshot-test.md) - the `js/json` roll-on-overflow test uses a small `maxGroupBytes` budget instead of megabytes of JSON
- [C++ through moq-ffi](/quest/m1/cpp/README.md) - generated C++ over moq-ffi with futures and expected-style errors, shipped as a tarball, vcpkg, and Conan, and adopted by the OBS plugin
- [Generated C bindings](/quest/m1/c/README.md) - C generated from moq-ffi ships as `moq-c` 0.8.0 and replaces the hand-written libmoq
- [Retire the libmoq stub](/quest/m1/libmoq-retire.md) - on dev, the published `libmoq` crate stops after its final release points users at `moq-c`
- [OBS native codecs](/quest/m1/obs-moq-video/README.md) - replace FFmpeg video and audio decoding with moq-video and moq-audio, deliver GPU frames, and use native audio/video encoders
- [Opus concealment](/quest/m1/opus-conceal.md) - a lost Opus packet conceals the last packet's length, not 120 ms
- [Audio codecs](/quest/m1/audio-codecs/README.md) - platform audio codecs, explicit unsupported cases, and channel layouts up to 7.1
- [Opus catalog rate](/quest/m1/opus-catalog-rate.md) - MKV Opus import publishes the 48 kHz codec rate in the catalog, not the OpusHead input rate
- [mp4-atom dOps mapping](/quest/m1/mp4-atom-dops-mapping.md) - a released mp4-atom reads and writes any `dOps` channel mapping family and table
- [CMAF surround Opus](/quest/m1/cmaf-opus-surround.md) - fMP4 import and export carry an Opus channel mapping table
- [js/hang dOps pre-skip](/quest/m1/js-dops-pre-skip.md) - CMAF encoding in js/hang stops hard-coding a 312-sample pre-skip
- [GPU CI](/quest/m1/gpu-ci.md) - NVIDIA tests run nightly on a self-hosted GPU runner, and `just rs nvidia` runs them locally instead of skipping
- [Capture cut test](/quest/m1/capture-cut-e2e.md) - the capture loop's keyframe throttle is tested end to end against an encoder with its own GOP
- [NVENC keyframe flag](/quest/m1/nvenc-keyframe-flag.md) - NVENC flags keyframes from its reported picture type instead of scanning the bitstream
- [JS rendition ranking](/quest/m1/js-ranked.md) - `@moq/hang` ranks video renditions like Rust, and `@moq/watch`'s fallback uses it
- [Audio rendition pick](/quest/m1/audio-ranked.md) - single-track FLV/RTMP and WHEP serve the best audio rendition, not the first by name
- [FLV rebind before header](/quest/m1/flv-rebind.md) - single-track FLV switches to a better rendition announced before the header
- [FLV catalog stream](/quest/m1/flv-catalog-stream.md) - on dev, `flv::Export` takes a catalog stream like fmp4, replacing `with_select`
- [Own the QUIC stack](/quest/m1/quic/README.md) - the moq-noq fork carries ACK progress, reliable reset, hierarchical scheduling, deadlines, peer limits, and qmux
- [QoS](/quest/m1/qos/README.md) - broadcast health: relay starvation and timeliness histograms, and client stats broadcasts from publishers and viewers, on dev
- [Drain](/quest/m1/drain/README.md) - relay restarts drain sessions over GOAWAY instead of hard-dropping them
- [Strict Redirect::resolve](/quest/m1/redirect-resolve.md) - on dev, `Redirect::resolve` can no longer quietly turn a refused redirect into a redial
- [Transport upgrade](/quest/m1/transport-upgrade/README.md) - a session that came up over WebSocket moves to QUIC once the QUIC dial lands, handing over at a group boundary
- [P2P](/quest/m1/p2p/README.md) - opted-in clients serve each other over data channels and iroh while the relay stays the rendezvous and the fallback, under application policy
- [One port](/quest/m1/one-port/README.md) - a relay speaks QUIC, STUN, WebRTC media, and SRT on one UDP port and HTTP, RTMP, and RTMPS on one TCP port
- [Signed priority](/quest/m1/signed-priority.md) - on dev, every API priority is an `i8` with 0 as the unset midpoint, and hang's built-ins sit above it
- [Scope track priority](/quest/m1/track-priority-scope.md) - priority orders one owner's streams, and a shared cluster session is fair across tenants
- [Stream sessions](/quest/m1/uring-tcp/README.md) - serve WebSocket and HTTP from the io_uring workers, where io_uring pays off most
- [IETF on the ring](/quest/m1/uring-ietf.md) - the io_uring workers serve moq-transport sessions too, so a uring relay drops no client protocol
- [BBR ACK cleanup](/quest/m1/bbr-ack-cleanup.md) - packet bookkeeping scales with completed entries instead of scanning the flight on every ACK
- [Perf](/quest/m1/perf/README.md) - eliminate measured hot-path costs across moq-uring, kio, and the moq-net model
- [#2924](/quest/m1/2924-moq-relay-tls-rotation-is-not-atomic-across-thread-per.md) - every listener on both runtimes shares one reloadable served identity, so rotation is atomic and generate works with workers

- [Bench coverage](/quest/m1/bench-coverage.md) - Criterion targets for moq-mux containers, the hang catalog, moq-auth verification, and moq-pattern matching
- [Stats producer bench](/quest/m1/stats-producer-bench.md) - the stats drain and encode cost per tick, swept over held paths and tiers and run nightly

- [Browser benchmarks](/quest/m1/browser-benchmarks.md) - measure JS transport, container, decode, and render costs in an identified browser
- [Generated @moq/net](/quest/m1/rs2ts/README.md) - the browser runs moq-net as TypeScript generated from the Rust source, retiring js/net's hand-written protocol and model code
- [Plan: watch worker](/quest/m1/plan-watch-worker.md) - prototype an invisible page worker against app-spawned workers, and land the jank harness that decides
- [Watch worker](/quest/m1/watch-worker.md) - watch playback runs in a worker onto an OffscreenCanvas, so main-thread jank never stalls video or audio
- [Closure counters](/quest/m1/closure-counters.md) - a departed node's return never regresses the closure counters a consumer already saw
- [RTMP interleaving](/quest/m1/rtmp-interleaving.md) - isolate partial messages before optimizing assembly copies
- [Cache expiry growth](/quest/m1/cache-expiry-growth.md) - with the default pool, relay memory plateaus at the expiry window on every version

- [Frame slot charge](/quest/m1/frame-slot-charge.md) - a group's frame slots past the first four count against the cache pool, including capacity a released group keeps
- [Relay memory](/quest/m1/relay-memory.md) - remeasure what an announcement costs after prefix routes
- [Front parking](/quest/m1/origin-front-parks.md) - an unroutable request waits on a front instead of re-asking on every route-table move
