# m2: later work

## Goal

Later work: deferred features, design studies, and experiments.

## Plan

Nothing here blocks a release. Promote a quest into
[m1](/quest/m1/README.md) when it joins the next wave, including planning
work whose decisions are worth settling now; deferral does not abandon a
feature. A study may end with a measured no-go. Work gated on hardware, a
partner, or a provider waits in [m3](/quest/m3/README.md); work waiting on an
upstream release waits in [m4](/quest/m4/README.md).

## Required

- [AV1 metadata separation](/quest/m2/av1-metadata.md) - retain metadata OBUs inline while evaluating separate delivery
- [SEI separation](/quest/m2/sei/README.md) - retain inline SEI until measured savings or a metadata-only consumer justify a split
