# Rust

The reference implementation. Every crate is on
[crates.io](https://crates.io/search?q=moq) with API docs on docs.rs.

## Crates

| Crate | Does |
| --- | --- |
| [moq-net](/lib/rs/moq-net) | The pub/sub layer: sessions, origins, broadcasts, tracks, groups, frames. Transport-agnostic. |
| [moq-pattern](https://docs.rs/moq-pattern) | Exact path patterns: grammar, matching, and set algebra. Re-exported by moq-net and moq-auth. |
| [moq-tokio](https://docs.rs/moq-tokio) | Stands up QUIC with noq, TLS, WebSocket fallback, and iroh, from config or CLI flags. |
| [moq-sock](https://docs.rs/moq-sock) | Dual-stack socket binding, `SO_REUSEPORT` groups steered by QUIC connection ID, and CPU pinning for thread-per-core listeners. |
| [moq-uring](https://docs.rs/moq-uring) | Experimental Linux io\_uring worker: one pinned thread per ring serving moq-lite over its own QUIC stack. |
| [hang](/lib/rs/hang) | The media layer: catalog, containers, ordered frame delivery. |
| [moq-mux](/lib/rs/moq-mux) | Import and export fMP4/CMAF, MPEG-TS, Matroska, FLV, and Annex-B. |
| [moq-archive](https://docs.rs/moq-archive) | Versioned hang recordings on any `object_store` backend: track layout, `.info` JSON, and segment objects. |
| [moq-video](/lib/rs/moq-video) | Native capture, hardware encode/decode (Apple, Windows, NVIDIA, VAAPI, V4L2, Android), and GPU rendering. |
| [moq-v4l](https://docs.rs/moq-v4l) | Safe Video4Linux 2 bindings with the kernel headers checked in, so a build needs no libclang. |

## Quick start

`moq-tokio` configures the endpoint; `moq-net` does the protocol.

```rust
// The Origin is the local hub: the session fills it with remote broadcasts
// and serves your local broadcasts out of it.
let origin = moq_tokio::origin::spawn();

let client = moq_tokio::connect::Config::default().init(Default::default())?;
let url = url::Url::parse("https://cdn.moq.dev/anon")?;
// Reconnects on its own; `closed()` resolves when it gives up.
let session = client.with_origin(origin.clone()).connect(url);

// Subscribe: wait for a route, resolve the broadcast at its path, read the catalog.
let consumer = origin.consume();
let mut announced = consumer.announced();
while let Some(event) = announced.next().await {
    // Skip retractions, and `Live`, which marks the end of what was already live.
    let moq_net::announce::Event::Start(update) = event else { continue };
    let broadcast = consumer.request_broadcast(&update.prefix).await?;
    let catalog = broadcast
        .track(hang::Catalog::DEFAULT_NAME)?
        .subscribe(hang::Catalog::default_subscription())
        .await?;
    // moq-mux decodes the catalog; moq-video / moq-audio decode the media.
}
```

```rust
// Publish: create and announce a broadcast on the origin, then fill it.
let mut broadcast = origin.publish("my-stream.hang", Default::default())?;
// moq-mux (from a container) or moq-video / moq-audio (from a device) fill it.
// The route retracts on `unannounce()` or when the broadcast ends. To serve a whole
// subtree on demand instead, `origin.dynamic("room", Default::default())?` yields
// each requested path for the application to accept or reject.
```

Before exiting, `session.close().await` delivers what was already queued, such as
the tracks you just finished, within one second. Then `Client::close` (on a clone of
the client) sends the QUIC close before the runtime stops.

The examples run the session and the origin work concurrently (`tokio::select!` or
`spawn`), since the announcement loop is live. Runnable examples:
[`rs/hang/examples/video.rs`](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/rs/hang/examples/video.rs)
(publish) and
[`subscribe.rs`](https://github.com/moq-dev/moq/blob/main/rs/hang/examples/subscribe.rs).
URLs may be `https://` (WebTransport, with raw QUIC preferred for native),
`moql://`/`moqt://` (raw QUIC), or `iroh://`. A `?jwt=` query carries the
token. `http://` is for a relay on localhost only: it fetches the certificate
fingerprint unauthenticated before upgrading, so never send a token over it. Connections race
QUIC against WebSocket and remember which won.

The `Default::default()` above is the QUIC transport section, and the same value
serves a dial and a listener:

```rust
let mut quic = moq_tokio::quic::Config::default();
quic.congestion_control = Some(moq_tokio::quic::CongestionControl::Delay);
quic.receive_window = Some(64 << 20);       // whole connection, in bytes
quic.stream_receive_window = Some(8 << 20); // per stream
quic.send_window = Some(32 << 20);          // unacknowledged data we may hold

let client = moq_tokio::connect::Config::default().init(quic)?;
```

Unset flow-control windows keep the transport defaults, and `init` errors on a
knob the transport cannot honor rather than dropping it: iroh cannot disable
GSO. `quic::Resolved::default()` is what an
untouched config resolves to, so read the defaults from there. The
[relay reference](/bin/relay/config#quic) documents each field.

## Connection monitoring

`Connection::monitor()` returns a cloneable `moq_tokio::connection::Monitor`
that observes the live session across reconnects without keeping the connection
loop alive. Its `stats()` and `snapshot()` return `None` between connections;
`connection::Snapshot` pairs transport statistics with the negotiated protocol.
Use `presence()` for cumulative connects and disconnects, or
`presence_changed().await` to wait for those counters to change.

## WebAssembly

`moq-net` compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and rides the browser's own
`WebTransport` through the `web-transport` crate, so Rust logic can be shared
between native and web. Skip `moq-tokio` there, build the transport with
`web_transport::ClientBuilder`, and drive the returned session future with
`wasm_bindgen_futures::spawn_local` (nothing is `Send` on wasm). If you just
want MoQ in a page, the [TypeScript libraries](/lib/js/) are the easier path.

## Conventions

The API is producer/consumer pairs at every level (origin, broadcast, track,
group). Producers write and consumers read; cloning a consumer shares the
subscription, and the last clone dropping closes it. Everything is
`async`, executor-agnostic, and errors are typed enums with `thiserror`.
